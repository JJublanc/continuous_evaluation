# Continuous evaluation

My conviction is that continuous evaluation help taking constantly better decisions and thus should be at the heart of organisations, in particular firms.

I am only talking about evaluation of actions, product, strategies and not at all the evaluation of individuals or groups of individuals.

### Why is it so important ?

First of all, evaluation enlights our decisions : 
* it drives us to stop what cost and do not bring any value
* it strenhgtens our confidence in actions that have a positive impact
* it helps communicating about the results we achieve

Secondly, a constant and effective evaluation system will :
* bring to tranform faster
* play down actions that does not work
* and thus allow to take more audacious decisions

This repo aim at showing how solutions can be impltemented to make tests in different kind of context. Those tools can be used to evaluate more systematically and faster.
